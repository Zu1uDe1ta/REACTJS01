# REACTJS 

WHAT IS REACT? 
- React is a javaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces for the web as well as mobile applications 
- It is an open-source, reusable component-based front-end library
- In a model view controller architecture. React ois the 'View' whcih is responsible for how the app looks and feels
- Instagram components: 
	- Search Component
	- Profile Description Component
	- Stories Component
	- Post List Component 
- React divides the UI into multiple components, which makes the code easier to debug, and each component has its own property and function. 

WHY REACT?
- Easy creation of dynamic web applications 
- Performance enhancements
- Reusable components 
- Unidirectional data flow
- Small learning curve
- Can be used for mobile apps 
(extension: ReactNative developing mobile apps that are cross compatible)
- dedicated tools for easy debugging

Cross-platform mobile development is the creation of software applications that are compatible with multiple mobile operating systems. Originally, the complexity of developing mobile apps was compounded by the difficulty of building out a backend that worked across multiple platforms.

FEATURES OF REACT
- JSX - JavaScript Syntax Extension
	- JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the User Interface should look like
	- By using JSX, you can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code
	- JSX helps in making the code easier to understand and debug as it avoids usage of JS DOM structures which are rather complex 
	- JSX = JS + HTML
		- ex: ``` const simple = <h1>Hello World!</h1>;```
